# Antelope BP Information Standard

**JSON Standard for Block Producer Information on Antelope (former EOSIO) Blockchains**

This is a proposed standard for Block Producer candidates to publish as the URL field of the `regproducer` action on
the `eosio.system` contract.

The current revision **v1.0.4** is compliant with the JSON
schema [Draft 2019-09](https://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#2019-09-formerly-known-as-draft-8)

### How to use it if you are Block Producer Candidate

Create a file named `bp.json` in the root of your domain. For instance `https://yourwebsite.com/bp.json` When you
register your producer using the `system.regproducer` action, the url field should be filled
with `https://yourwebsite.com`. **Do not put the bp.json file in the url.**

### Overriding data for specific chains

The recommended way to specify multiple bp.json files under the same domain is to use the a `chains.json` file pointing
to each `<chain>.json` file according to the chain_id, for example:

```json
{
  "chains": {
    "aca376f206b8fc25a6ed44dbdc66547c36c6c33e3a119ffbeaef943642f0e906": "/bp.json",
    "1064487b3cd1a897ce03ae5b6a865651747e2e152090f99c1d19d44e01aea5a4": "/wax.json",
    "4667b205c6838ef70ff7988f6e8257e8be0e1284a2f59699054a018f743b1d11": "/telos.json",
    "21dcae42c0182200e93f954a074011f9048a7624c6fe81d3c9541a614a88bd1c": "/fio.json",
    "38b1d7815474d0c60683ecbea321d723e83f5da6ae5f1c1f9fecc69d9ba96465": "/libre.json",
    "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000123": "/other_chain.json"
  }
}
```

It's posible to not include the slash on the sub-url value, as it is implied we are building an url.

You can also override properties of the base `bp.json` file by creating a chain specific json file next to your base.

```
--/
----index.html
----chains.json
----bp.json
----chainA.json
----chainB.json
----bp.${chain_id}.json
----bp.aca376f206b8fc25a6ed44dbdc66547c36c6c33e3a119ffbeaef943642f0e906.json
```

The `bp.json` and `bp.${chain_id}.json` will be merged and any property inside of the chain specific json file will
override the base properties.

### API Features

For query type nodes one or more features from the list below must be added:

- `chain-api`: basic eosio::chain_api_plugin (/v1/chain/*)
- `account-query`: (/v1/chain/get_accounts_by_authorizers)
- `history-v1`: (/v1/history/*)
- `hyperion-v2`: (/v2/*)
- `dfuse`
- `fio-api`
- `snapshot-api`
- `dsp-api`
- `atomic-assets-api`
- `light-api`
- `ipfs`
- `firehose`
